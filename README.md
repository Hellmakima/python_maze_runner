# Maze Runner

**Maze Runner** is a dynamic maze generation and exploration program implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Description

This project generates randomized mazes and allows interactive navigation through them. Key features include:

- **Maze Generation**: Using algorithmic techniques to create randomized mazes.
- **Dynamic Maze Changes**: The maze evolves over time with changing paths.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate the maze using arrow keys or designated controls.
- **Visualization**: Rendered using Pygame to provide visual feedback and enhance the gaming experience.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)
